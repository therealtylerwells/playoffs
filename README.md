# Playoffs 

The 2018 postseason schedule as if it hadn't happened yet but we know who will win and pitch every game. In production, we'd avoid inline styling, make everything responsive, include image assets for leagues/networks/tickets/preview, add a loading indicator, make the links work, etc.

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/therealtylerwells/playoffs

cd playoffs

npm install

npm start
```
