# Playoffs 

I did this during a job interview process w/ MLB dot com. They ghosted me in return. I don't think it's that bad.

## Run it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/therealtylerwells/playoffs

cd playoffs

npm install

npm start
```

If it doesn't open in the browser automatically then visit http://localhost:3000 to check it out
